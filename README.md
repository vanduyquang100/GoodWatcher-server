## Overview

GoodWatcher is a cross-platform Java Swing desktop application that utilizes Socket programming to enable remote folder monitoring. The project uses a custom UI theme inspired by WinUI 3 Fluent Design System, follow more [here](https://github.com/vanduyquang100/swingdows).

This version serves as the **_server_** component of the application, responsible for reporting changes from watched folders of all registered clients.

## Prerequisites

**Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8** or higher.

## Features

### Connect Using Passcodes

The server-side application generates a unique hashed connection passcode for each connection request. Clients can utilize this code to establish a connection with the server.

### Server-Side Folder Tree Viewer for Clients

The server-side application provides the capability to navigate and select specific folders on clients' desktops through the directory tree directly. This feature enables convenient folder selection and monitoring from the server side.

**_Notes:_** Each PC can only have one watched folder per server.

### Real-Time Folder Change Monitoring

The program provides real-time updates for changes made to a client's folder, ensuring instant synchronization with the server. It automatically detects when files or subfolders are edited, created, or deleted, ensuring you stay up-to-date with your folder's activity.
